## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### Design Philosophy (Max 1000 chars)

This API follows a **layered architecture** with clear separation of concerns:

**1. Domain Layer**: Entities use Single Table Inheritance for Client polymorphism (Person/Company), enabling type-safe operations while maintaining referential integrity. Immutable fields (birthDate, companyIdentifier) are enforced at the database level.

**2. Repository Layer**: Spring Data JPA with optimized queries. The performant total-cost endpoint uses a single aggregation query with proper indexing on endDate and clientId.

**3. Service Layer**: Business logic including soft-delete (contracts end-dated on client deletion) and automatic timestamp management (lastModifiedDate hidden from API).

**4. Controller Layer**: RESTful endpoints with comprehensive validation using Jakarta Bean Validation.

**Key Decisions**:
- H2 file-based database for persistence across restarts
- Soft-delete pattern preserves audit trail
- ISO 8601 date formatting throughout
- Indexed queries for performance
- Transactional consistency for cascading operations

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Java 21 or higher
- Maven 3.6+
- Spring boot 3.2.0

### Running the Application

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd insurance-api
```

2. **Build the project**

## 🧪 Testing the API

### Using cURL

**Create a Person:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/clients/persons \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
      "firstName": "Mijoe",
      "lastName": "Ndong",
      "birthDate": "1990-01-15",
      "clientType": "PERSON",
      "phone": "+33606060606",
      "email": "john.doe@example.com"  
    }'
```

**Create a Contract for client with clientID n°1 :**

Required fields:
- `costAmount` (required): The cost amount of the contract (must be a positive number with 2 decimal places)

Optional fields:
- `startDate` (optional, defaults to current date if not provided): The start date of the contract in 'YYYY-MM-DD' format
- `endDate` (optional): The end date of the contract in 'YYYY-MM-DD' format (null for indefinite contracts)

Example:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/clients/1/contracts \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "startDate": "2024-01-01",
    "endDate": "2025-12-31",
    "costAmount": 2500.00
  }'
```

Minimum valid request (uses current date as start date and no end date):
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/clients/1/contracts \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"costAmount": 1500.50}'
```

**Get Total Cost:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/api/clients/1/contracts/total-cost
```

### Using Postman

Import the provided collection: `docs/Insurance-API.postman_collection.json`

### Validation Examples

The API validates all inputs:

**Invalid Email:**
```json
{
  "name": "Test",
  "email": "invalid-email",
  "phone": "+41211234567",
  "birthDate": "1990-01-01"
}
```
Response: `400 Bad Request` with validation errors

**Invalid Company Identifier:**
```json
{
  "companyIdentifier": "INVALID"
}
```
Response: `400 Bad Request` - Must match format XXX-123

**Invalid Cost Amount:**
```json
{
  "costAmount": -100
}
```
Response: `400 Bad Request` - Must be positive

## 🔍 Key Features

### ✅ Implemented Requirements

- [x] Create Person and Company clients with validation
- [x] Read client with all fields
- [x] Update client (excluding immutable fields)
- [x] Delete client with contract end-dating
- [x] Create contracts with default start date
- [x] Update contract cost with automatic timestamp
- [x] Get active contracts with optional date filtering
- [x] Performant total cost calculation endpoint
- [x] ISO 8601 date format throughout
- [x] Comprehensive validation (email, phone, dates, numbers)
- [x] RESTful API design with JSON
- [x] File-based persistence (survives restarts)
- [x] Descriptive code with clear naming

### 🚀 Performance Optimizations

1. **Database Indexes**: On ids of contract and clients
2. **Aggregation Query**: Single query for total cost calculation
3. **Transactional Boundaries**: Proper transaction management
4. **Query Optimization**: Filtered queries at database level

### 🛡️ Data Integrity

- Immutable fields enforced at entity level
- Validation at multiple layers (DTO, Entity, Database)
- Soft-delete pattern for audit trail
- Transactional consistency for cascading operations

---

## 📝 Notes

- Database persists in `./data/insurance.mv.db`
- All dates use ISO 8601 format
- Active contracts: `endDate == null OR endDate > currentDate`
- lastModifiedDate is internal and not exposed in API responses
- Company identifier format: 3 uppercase letters, hyphen, 3 digits (e.g., ABC-123)
